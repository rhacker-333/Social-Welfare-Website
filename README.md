🌱 My First Ever Web Project
This was the very first project I created during my first semester of college. The codebase is messy, incomplete, and doesn’t fully work — but I’ve kept it here for memory’s sake and to remind myself how far I’ve come.

🔍 What's Working:
The blog.html file opens a basic web page.

Some static content and minimal JavaScript are present.

⚠️ What's Missing / Broken:
No backend implementation.

Other pages are either unlinked or non-functional.

UI is unpolished and there may be congestion/errors in the code.

📌 Note:
I plan to add proper README instructions later. For now, this stands as a snapshot of my earliest attempt at web development.
